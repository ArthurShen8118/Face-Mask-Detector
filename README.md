## Motivation
Due to cases of  COVID-19 ramping up, we need to do something to restrict the servere spread of the virus. This project presents one of AI concepts as deep learning approach with computer vision to detect wether people wear mask or not. We can apply this concept to the another technologies more around our daily life ex: Face ID lock, Check in System.

 



## TechStack used


- [Keras](https://pytorch.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)


##  Dataset


This dataset consists of __1300 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 650 images__
*	__without_mask: 650 images__

The dataset were collected from the following sources:

* __Kaggle__ 




## Features
A method to use the dataset from Kaggle to train the predication model by Convolutional Neural Network on Google Colab. And we trun on our webcam to detect if we wear mask properly. However, if we fail to wear mask, the detector will take the picture and do the record. The result is good.
